Learn and practice about classes

## Classes
1. What are constructor functions?
---
Constructor functions provide a way of creating numerous objects of the same type. they're named after the data they create(starting with a capital letter).

and also we can add properties or methods to the objects created by the constructor function via the prototype keyword

1. Easy Prototypal Inheritance with Classes
---
Classes and construction functions are in much cases the way, classes is just a simple way to make construction functions.

To declare a class we use the keyword class with the first letter capitalizer.

And as constructor function classes has curly braces but not parenthesis.

so classes just are mutated functions, the propose with classes is the same the constructor functions, create objects with shared methods.

In the classes you don't declare method with prototype like constructor function, you can add methos inside de curly braces of the class.

we have this special method for initialize values call constructor
